# Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations

G.D. Smith's classic text offers a clear and structured introduction to finite difference methods for solving partial differential equations. While a general mathematical text, it is foundational for quantitative finance, particularly in the numerical pricing of derivatives where analytical solutions are unavailable. The book covers parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic equations with a focus on stability, convergence, and consistency.

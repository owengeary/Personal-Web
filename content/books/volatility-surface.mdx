# The Volatility Surface

Jim Gatheral's text is a leading reference for modeling implied volatility. It addresses the practical challenges of pricing and hedging in markets where the Black-Scholes assumption of constant volatility fails. The book explores stochastic volatility models, local volatility, and the dynamics of the volatility surface itself, offering deep insights for quant developers and traders involved in exotics and equity derivatives.
